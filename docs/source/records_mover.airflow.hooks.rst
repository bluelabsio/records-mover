   SqlAlchemyDbHook.validate_and_prepare_target_directory is something
   I'd like to explore removing and promoting to something
   non-Airflow-related, so let's not include a docstring for it and leave
   ':undoc-members:' out of the config below.

   :show-inheritance:
   :special-members: __init__
