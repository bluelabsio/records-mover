    #
    # The behavior is as follows:
    #
    # boolean. If True -> try parsing the index.
    #
    # list of int or names. e.g. If [1, 2, 3] -> try parsing columns
    # 1, 2, 3 each as a separate date column.

    # call result ‘foo’
    #
    # If a column or index cannot be represented as an array of
    # datetimes, say because of an unparseable value or a mixture of
    # timezones, the column or index will be returned unaltered as an
    # object data type. For non-standard datetime parsing, use
    # pd.to_datetime after pd.read_csv. To parse an index or column
    # with a mixture of timezones, specify date_parser to be a
    # partially-applied pandas.to_datetime() with utc=True. See

    # Internally process the file in chunks, resulting in lower memory
    # use while parsing, but possibly mixed type inference. To ensure
    # no mixed types either set False, or specify the type with the
    # dtype parameter. Note that the entire file is read into a single
    # DataFrame regardless, use the chunksize or iterator parameter to
    # return the data in chunks. (Only valid with C parser).

    # object directly onto memory and access the data directly from
    # there. Using this option can improve performance because there
    # is no longer any I/O overhead.

    # be a knob to play with if we need more performance...)

    # Specifies which converter the C engine should use for
    # floating-point values. The options are None for the ordinary
    # converter, high for the high-precision converter, and round_trip
    # for the round-trip converter.
    #

    # (something to look for if we need more performance...)
